## Overview

This assignment <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes" target="_blank" noreferrer>Project: Recipes</a> was set as part of the<a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/" target="_blank" noreferrer>> The Odin Project</a> curriculum. This is a very basic website with 3 recipe pages.

## Considerations

Project was fairly basic and easy. Just to practice HTML knowledge acquired from foundations. Great to refresh memory and later practiced and added CSS properties. :smiley:
