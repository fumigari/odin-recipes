				<h3>Ingredients</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>100 (3.5 inch square) wonton wrappers</li>
					<li>1 Â¾ pounds ground pork</li>
					<li>1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root</li>
					<li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
					<li>2 tablespoons thinly sliced green onion</li>
					<li>4 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
					<li>3 tablespoons sesame oil</li>
					<li>1 egg, beaten</li>
					<li>5 cups finely shredded Chinese cabbage</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Steps</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>In a large bowl, combine the pork, ginger, garlic, green onion, soy sauce, sesame oil, egg and cabbage.
						Stir
						until well mixed.</li>
					<li>Place 1 heaping teaspoon of pork filling onto each wonton skin. Moisten edges with water and fold edges
						over to
						form a triangle shape. Roll edges slightly to seal in filling. Set dumplings aside on a lightly floured
						surface
						until ready to cook.</li>
					<li>Arrange dumplings in a covered bamboo or metal steamer so they don't touch to prevent them from sticking
						together; steam for 15 minutes, or until pork is cooked through.</li>
					<li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
